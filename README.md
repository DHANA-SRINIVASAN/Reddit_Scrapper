# Reddit_Scrapper
I developed a Reddit scraper in Python using `Praw` to collect posts, comments, and user interactions from specific subreddits. The data is cleaned, stored in CSV/SQL formats, and analyzed for insights like sentiment analysis and word clouds, demonstrating my skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and analysis.
